                    This is where it all started.  I met Akisha here in April of 2015 at Perfect 10 strip club north of Austin, Texas.
                    When I first saw her she was sitting with some guy but I stopped to look because something about her was so alluring.
                    A few minutes later Akisha strolled into the VIP area where I was sitting and I was again stunned.  Love at first sight.
                    She sat down and we talked a bit and I was even more hooked.  She gave me a few dances and then some other girl grabbed 
                    her to take her to some guy that she'd found that was supposedly throwing around money (he wasn't).  
                    She came back after a little bit and we talked and she danced some more.  I was completely hooked.  
                    I came back frequently just to see her.  It wasn't long before I was pestering her for her phone number.
                    After about a month and a half, she finally gave it to me.

                    <p>I texted her fairly regularly after having gotten her number.  
                    One day I asked for a picture of her as she looked right then.  She didn't want to at first because she didn't have any 
                    makeup on and no wig (which she wore when she danced and was the only way I had ever seen her).
                    I kept asking and she sent me this photo.  Completely real.  I loved it.  I love curly hair like this but she never really 
                    liked her hair, which is why she wore wigs a lot.  I thought we'd start dating soon but it took a little longer. </p>
                    <p>Turns out she was dating someone.  I'd see her at the club often and she'd talk about how he wasn't right for her.
                    It still took about three months after she gave me her phone number for us to start seeing each other.</p>
                    She texted me one day and asked if she could call, of course I said yes, and when she did she asked if I'd come pick her up.  
                    She said that she was breaking up with her boyfriend and didn't want to stay at her apartment because she knew he'd 
                    come there and bang on her door and she didn't want to hear it because she knew she'd let him in and she didn't want him 
                    to try to convince her to stay with him.  So, I went and picked her up and brought her to my place.</p>
                    <p>As we talked, she said she didn't want to go back to the club to work anymore, although by this time she had stopped
                    dancing and was only waitressing (and of course not making much money).  I said don't go back and I'll help you out.
                    It was both a good and stupid move because coming out of a relationship she wasn't really ready for another one and I 
                    said that I was willing to give it some time because I wanted as serious relationship with her.</p>

                      At first, we saw each other pretty frequently going to do things like horseback rides, eating at nice restaurants, and other things.

                      After a month or so, she said she wanted to visit her friend in LA.  So, she drove to LA (stopping at the grand canyon 
                      along the way) and spent about a week and a half there.  She was supposed to stay a couple of weeks but came back early 
                      and just said things didn't go so great.  It was after this trip that things started going downhill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She was more distant and we didn't do much together for the next month.
                      We had dinner one evening and this is when she told me more about her time in LA prior to us meeting.  
                      She had previously told me that she went to LA right after high school to work on her singing career.  
                      She had mentioned that she had been part of some music jam thing that she did really well at.  
                      Turns out that she had won the festival when she had just turned 17.  The result of this was that she was supposed 
                      to get some time with some music production professional(s) and she wrote a couple songs and released them on youtube.  
                      I've never heard them and don't know how successful they were.  However, this made her think that she could go to LA 
                      and jump into a music career.  Well, things didn't go that smoothly and at our dinner she told me that she wound up 
                      getting a sugardaddy to pay the bills.  She said he wasn't paying her very much (and was still complaining about 
                      not getting enough sex) so that's when she started stripping.  At the dinner she told me that he was still hounding 
                      her to come back and he'd take better care of her but he was also trying to cause her a lot of trouble by trying to 
                      hack her email and bank accounts.  I told her she needed to not contact or respond to him at all.
                      I always wondered if that's who she actually went to see on her trip to LA.

                      By this time Thanksgiving had rolled around and she said she was going to stay with her family over the holiday and 
                      we wouldn't be able to see each other much.  I was hoping that after a little break like that she'd come back with 
                      a better attitude.  She didn't.

                      Through the month of December things were just as bad and I was just going to end it.  We had a discussion over the phone
                      one night and although it wasn't said that it was over I just kinda figured it was.  Prior to that call we had made 
                      some plans to go to Top Golf.  I assumed those plans were off but the day came and she texted me about going.  I said 
                      you still want to go?  She said "yes" and I went and picked her up.  Well, something had changed because she was 
                      completely different.  She was much happier and we had a great time and she was very affectionate (making out with 
                      me at Top Golf).

                      We went out again a couple days later and again had a great time. I thought things were on a new and very positive track.
                      This was just before Christmas.   She once again said she'd be staying with her family and we wouldn't likely see each 
                      other until after the holiday.  She had mentioned going to this big outlet mall south of Austin after Christmas.  
                      On the day we were going she asked if she could bring a friend and I said sure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The mall was about an hour away and while driving we all chatted and at one point her friend brought up that he (her 
                      friend is gay) had a friend from college coming up and he said "hey, we should get together when she's here" I thought 
                      nothing of it as I didn't expect that he meant me just Akisha him and his friend. I didn't want to sit around with a 
                      bunch of 20 year olds getting high anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Shortly after, we arrived at the shopping center and when I got out of the car I looked at my phone and saw that I had 
                      a text message.  I looked at the message and saw it was from Akisha.  Thinking this was strange, I read it and the 
                      message said (paraphrasing): <span style="font-style: italic">don't say anything about getting together with your 
                      friend because he'll want to come wtih us and I don't want him to</span>. Obviously she meant to send this to her 
                      friend, not me.  As you can imagine this stung quite a bit, even though I wasn't interested in going with them in 
                      the first place.  I didn't say anything as we had just gotten there and I didn't want a long awkward trip back.  
                      So, we strolled around and looked at (expensive) purses that Akisha wanted.  After a while we were looking at a 
                      purse she really wanted I said "maybe another time".  Shortly after that we left to go back home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the way back, Akisha asked if she could see my phone to put on some music (there was much less conversation on 
                      the return trip) and of course she deleted the message she'd sent me.  When we got back to my place her friend say 
                      he'd wait in their car to give Akisha and me some alone time but she immediately told him it wasn't necessary.
                      Akisha and I went to my bedroom and she laid down on the bed face first and buried her face in her phone not looking 
                      at me at all.  I asked if we were going to talk about the message.  She said <span style="font-style: italic">what message?</span>. 
                      I said the one you meant to send to your friend.  She replied, "I meant to send that to you".  
                      I was pretty shocked and said that the message didn't make sense to send to me and if it was meant for me then why'd 
                      you delete it.  She said <span style="font-style: italic">I just didn't think it was important</span>.  
                      She refused to admit to it and ultimately just got up and left.  There wasn't much else she could do if she wasn't 
                      going to be honest.  Running away is how she handles most of the problems she creates.
                      Since I was paying her bills and it was getting close to the end of the month, I texted her a couple of days later 
                      and said if you'll just come over and be honest about it and talk it out, I'll pay your rent.  She said she'd think 
                      about it but came back pretty quickly and said no. I'd even tried to let her know that it wasn't the worst situtation 
                      if she'd just admit to it and just apologize and just take responsibility we could work it out.  But this is who she is, 
                      she won't admit guilt or responsibility for anything no matter how much proof you have.  She'd rather just run away 
                      to a new (or old) guy and start over.
                    </p>
                    <p>That ended our first relationship, but not our story.</p>

                      Chapter two began a little over a year later when I moved back to Austin.  I was walking into Perfect 10 
                      one evening right when Akisha was walking out.  We stared at each other for a few seconds not knowing what to do 
                      and I finally asked her if she wanted to join me inside.  She did and we talked (and other things) for a bit.
                      We seemed to fall back into our old ways and had fun, which I was very happy about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I continued to see her at the club and after a few months she texted me asking that if she needed a place to stay 
                      could she stay with me.  I said yes.  It was only a few days (maybe a week) later that she asked to come stay with me.
                      She was obviously running away from another relationship (other source later proved that to be the case).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When she came to my place she was of course in financial dire straights and she said that she didn't want to go back 
                      to the club.  I told her that I didn't want to be her sugardaddy and that I'd loan her the money and she'd need to 
                      pay it back and she agreed.  Things were a little strange this go around and it wasn't even what you'd call an attempt 
                      by her to have a relationship (especially since I wasn't willing to throw cash at her).  She really didn't even stay 
                      there much.  I think she was spending time at her sister's.  It was a little strange because she told me that "a friend" 
                      of her's was going into the military but didn't say who.  I found out later that it was her sister.  
                      Not sure why she was being so secertive about it, but that's who Akisha is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Things took a sour turn when she texted me one day asking if I'd take her shopping for some clothes for a photoshoot 
                      she was going to be doing.  I believe the photo above is from one of the photoshoots she did around that time.  There

                      I told her that as I said in the beginning that I wasn't going down that road.  From that point on she was quite unfriendly 
                      and apparently found someone that would.  She went on a trip with someone, I assume it was her new sugardaddy, 
                      and when she came back she moved out.  I asked her to pay me back the money she owed me and she said she didn't have it.  
                      Being pretty pissed, I said to get it from your sugardaddy or go back to the club to make the money.  
                      She she didn't want to do that and said she'd pay me when she could. Shockingly, she paid me monthly until it was 
                      all paid back.

                    <p>Chapter three started about two years later (July 2019).  It took me about that long to accept that there wasn't 
                      going to be a chapter three.  The funny part is that I was on a sugardaddy site and saw her profile pop up.  It was 
                      there for a few weeks maybe then disappeared.  It was about a month later that I got an email from her saying "I've 
                      grown up quite a bit and would love to reconnect with you" and she gave me her phone number.  I called her almost 
                      immediately and during our conversation I said I'd only want to try again if she was serious about a relationship and 
                      she assured me that she was.  It was almost immediately obvious that she wasn't and what she meant by matured was that 
                      she thought she was better at hiding what $he wa$ really after.  We arranged to have dinner just a couple days after 
                      we talked.  During one text conversation she said maybe we can go shopping too.  So, when I picked her up she was 
                      stunning (see the above picture).  We got to the restauarant/shopping center and as we started to walk to the 
                      restaurant she stopped and said maybe we should go shopping first just in case the stores closed before we were done 
                      with dinner.  You can see (part of) the result of said shopping trip in the above photo.  She finally got her purse.</p>

                      Chapter 4...  This is a drawn out chapter.  Akisha contacted me in February of 2020 (yeah, right before COVID hit).  
                      She was crying (not literally) about how she wished that she could come over to my place and talk and enjoy being together.  
                      What she didn't know is that I no longer lived in Austin.  What I didn't know at that moment was that she 
                      had "moved" to Seattle to live with a friend.  Who knows what happened between her ghosting me and her 
                      trip to Seattle but she wasn't very happy being there.  Her friend's husband was abusive and her friend
                      was..., well, it wasn't a good situation.  In the weeks that went by we talked and talked and talked and there 
                      was some talk of getting back together but when I lost my job due to COVID and told her that things might 
                      be a little unstable for a bit, she pretty much stopped talking to me.

                      After about four months I texted her to see how she was doing.  She had moved back to Austin (without saying anything to me).  
                      I guess OnlyFans was paying off well enough that she didn't need me for anything.  We started talking again and it 
                      was a bit more serious this time and she eventually said she'd come up to Dallas, where I now lived, 
                      for a weekend with the expectation that she was going to move in with me.

                      So, the weekend went OK although we had a couple of disagreements on things that were kind of out of the ordinary 
                      for us (in my opinion she was being petty).  The weekend ended on kind of a weird note even though most of the weekend 
                      was actually really fun.  A few days later she said she wasn't going to move in with me.  Two weeks later she'd moved to LA.
                      A month after that (with no communication in between), I get a text saying "miss you".
                      This mostly meant miss your money because she had apparently quit working on her OnlyFans and I'm guessing that that 
                      money had run out.

                      Things started off a bit strained but she quickly asked me to buy her a flight to visit her sister for Christmas and 
                      New Years and that she'd come visit me for a few days first.  I agreed and we started back up again.  Her tone was much 
                      more serious now.  I think she was still mostly in sugarbaby mode but there was definitely a more serious intent, more 
                      so than at any time in the past.  We talked a LOT in the run up to the trip.  During this time I agreed to pay her 
                      bills and rent since she'd be away for so long and not making any money (she wasn't making much anyway).

                    <p>
                      When she arrived things went quite well, of course she had her Christmas list in tow and as expected it wasn't cheap.  
                      This was in addition to jewelery that I had already bought for her before she even got here.  
                      The trip went ok but she decided to take a (short) trip to Austin to see her friends during what was supposed to 
                      be our time together.  You can guess I wasn't real happy about that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When she left for her sister's on Christmas eve, I gave her my credit card so that she'd be able to take care of herself 
                      while away.  Things went to complete shit by Christmas night.  She called me up crying because her sister had thrown 
                      her out of her house and she was standing on the sidewalk with her bags.  Her sister lived on a military base so 
                      being kicked out was worse than had it been anywhere else.  Being an "unauthorized" civilian on a military base is 
                      not where you want to be.  She was in a shambles to say the least.  However, I was able to get her a Lyft and a 
                      hotel so that she'd be safe.  It took a couple days to get her flight rearranged but we got her back home.  
                      Note that she wouldn't come back to Dallas to spend New Years with me.

                      Once she got back home we started making many more plans to be together.  During COVID, flights were cheap so we booked 
                      several in advance.  One such trip was for Valentine's Day weekend (over a month and a half away).

                    <p>
                      Akisha came to Dallas a couple weeks after the ill fated trip to her sister's and we had a great time.  So great in fact that we got engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I actually couldn't believe it.  We had talked a little bit about getting married but it wasn't like imminent marriage 
                      type of talk more like in 6 months (after all, at this point we'd known each other for over 5 years).
                      So, one day we were shopping at the mall and I wanted to go to a jewelry store to see what type of rings she liked 
                      so when the time came I could buy something she liked.  As we were looking at rings, Akisha got more and more excited 
                      and I kept saying that I didn't bring her in there to get a ring today.  however, she got so enthralled with the ring 
                      that she asked "what's happening?".  At that point I said lets step out of the store and talk.  I told her that I 
                      loved her and certainly wanted to marry her but that this was not my planned way of doing this.  However, if she 
                      wanted this now I am certainly ready and she excitedly said yes she wanted it.  We went back in and ordered the ring.  
                      They needed to resize it but it would only take an hour.  So, we waited and talked about our future and having kids 
                      and when it was time for the ring to be done we went and picked it up and I got down on one knee and proposed.  
                      I couldn't have been happier.

                      I guess I should have known that things weren't going to work out when the next day she asked if we could go back and 
                      get a bigger, better ring
                    </p>

                      Things were actually great for a while (i.e. a month).  This is when the Valentine's trip was coming.  The dates had to 
                      be changed a little because she was potentially shooting a commercial in the Dallas area sometime after Valentine's 
                      weekend and needed to be available potentially on a moments notice.  Still all good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Then, a few days before the weekend, things started gettin weird. She was scheduled to come on the 11th.  On the 9th 
                      these were the texts that we sent each other.  As you can see, Everything was great.

                    <p>
                      Things started to turn the next day.

                      We had this trip planned for over a month and a half.  What was it that she now needed extra time to get done? It was 
                      never explained (more on this later).  Also, not getting the "gig" had nothing to do with needing extra time because 
                      the shoot for that wasn't until some time after the weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Things got even more weird that night.  Suddenly, me paying ALL her bills, and when I say ALL I mean more than she 
                      would ever spend if she were paying them.  She suddenly didn't like that she was paying for everything by using my 
                      credit card which if you recall I gave her when she left to go to her sister's.  So, we had a three hour conversation 
                      the night of the 10th explaining that she needed to control her spending and that if I'm paying the bills I'm going 
                      to pay them in the way that best suits me.  The call ended on an OK note (for me anyway).

                    <p>
                      The next day got worse.  Note the length of time between the first few messages.

                      Note the ultimatums to be paid in cash and calling me a liar when I had previous text converstations telling her exactly 
                      that and had the same conversation several months before.  Also, there had been no mention of her feeling ill at all 
                      and as you'll see she claims that it had been a problem for a few days, not once did I hear about it. That message 
                      came about 2 hours after another long call that was after the  text message that said "call me".  She sent it then 
                      becuase she knew I would be asleep by then.  I wasn't.  I was so upset and getting a little pissed about the delayed 
                      trip and radically different attitude that I couldn't go to sleep.  I chose not to respond immediately and eventually 
                      went to sleep.  Here are the texts from the next day, the 12th, where she now mentions that she'd been having this 
                      problem for days (without ever having said anything about it previously).

                      New day, new drama.  Of course she wasn't feeling better and now she had to rebook the flight for Saturday, the 13th.  
                      Saturday comes and guess what, she's still not feeling well enough to travel and says she's going to have to rebook the
                      flight for Monday or Tuesday.  Guess how I'm feeling.  Saturday night rolls around and since I'm alone and doing nothing 
                      because my fiancè is 1500 miles away I decide to call so I can at least talk to her and get to hear her voice.  
                      When she answers, the call has terrible audio and after a few sentences I ask if she's in her car becuase the sound is 
                      terrible.  She says yes let me call you back.  She calls back right away and it's still terrible and I ask her where 
                      she's going and why she's out on a cold night when she's too sick to travel?  She sort of says she's feeling better so 
                      I ask if she can come tomorrow, i.e. Valentine's Day.  She snaps back with "why tomorrow?".  I'm like, for the same 
                      reason I wanted you here three days ago.  She's mostly evading all my questions and at this point I'm pretty pissed 
                      and basically tell her that she's lying and that she better start being honest.  Of course she hangs up and few 
                      unpleasnt text messages go back and  forth and that ends the night and effectively our relationship as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I texted her a few days later imploring her to be honest but she claimed that she was honest and wouldn't discuss it further.  
                      It was the last contact we had for nearly a year.

                      So, let's rewind a bit to get a better picture of what was really going on.  On Feb 9th (the day that things were so 
                      wonderful and I was wonderful), Akisha got an STD test.  Below is the charge shown on my credit card and it's from an 
                      STD testing facility (Google it yourself or call the number).  
                      <div><img src="./images/std-test-charge.png" width="100%" alt="Akisha Petties std test" /></div><br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So, was her need for a delay on the 10th due to the need to wait until she got her test results back?
                      Now, I didn't even look at most of the charges that she was making in much detail and in fact I didn't start validating 
                      them until many months later.  When I saw this one and found out what it was, it seemed to validate what I 
                      had been thinking.  However, since she had been using my card to buy things for other people (likely to have them give 
                      her the cash so that she could use it to support her marijuana habit), I thought that maybe she had purchased it for 
                      someone she knows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It wasn't until even much later that I called the testing facility claiming possible fraudulent charges and asked them if 
                      Akisha Petties had used my card to order tests from them.  They verified that she had ordered the tests on Feb 9th 2021 
                      and that the charge was for $198, the exact amount of their STD test suite (even today that's what they charge).  
                      So, had Akisha been screwing around and caught an STD and needed time to get treatment for it before she came to visit?  
                      Maybe, but I think something else was going on.  Her sudden demands for cash and her propensity for sugar daddies makes 
                      me think that she was planning to spend the weekend with someone that would pay her to be their Valentine's weekend 
                      treat and that she needed the test to prove that she was clean enough to perform as required for the weekend.  Another 
                      thing that supports this is that she made no charges at all on my card that weekend.  From the time I had given her my 
                      card in Decemnber, until that weekend, there was only one day, where she wasn't in Dallas with me, that she didn't make 
                      a charge on the card.  Then there was the entire Valentine's weekend without any charges.  There were charges every day 
                      the week before and there were charges starting again on the Monday after that weekend and every after day until I cut 
                      the card off.  I guess she didn't need to buy anything because someone else was paying the bills that weekend.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It wasn't until over a year later that she said to me that she was going to the grocery store that Saturday night.  
                      If that was the case, why didn't she use my card?  She had no problem using it A LOT right before that weekend and right 
                      after so why not use it to pay for some groceries.  Also, Akisha had no problem calling DoorDash to bring her food 
                      (and charging it to my card of course).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One more thing, Akisha would NEVER go to a doctor.  She basically doesn't believe in modern medicine (unless 
                      it's to get new boobs and lips, apparently).  She wouldn't so much as take a Tylenol when she was feeling bad, 
                      which I had actually asked her to do while she was "ill" with this terrible earache, sore throat, and headache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Akisha was so broken up about this that she was married less than 8 months later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I could have said more and gone into more detail but this should give you an idea of how selfish, 
                      deceitful, and manipulative she is.
